                    <p class="about">Hey Ella!<br>recently I have heard about and read one of your book Night Vision and I loved the book. It is an enjoyable book to read, it was great that our teacher Miss Allan had found a book that was so interesting. In my opinion, the book was an enjoyable book to read at the start I already started to put my mindset into the book and imagined that I was really in the scene of the book. At the start, my emotions were all over the place I was shocked, thrilled and excited. Who wouldn't after a kid just witnessed a crime of theft and murder. At the front of the book, there was a question saying "Would you take the money and run?" when I reached the point in the middle or towards the end it started to make sense.<br><br>Rating this book I would rate it 8/10 the reason I have chosen this score is that it was a really interesting book in the story I don't think that there was any part that I was interested in I loved it. I would have given it a full score but I would love the ending to be a bit longer I feel like it was a bit rushed in the end. When I finished reading the book I had so many questions in my head for example, "Is that it?" or "I want to know more". It just would have been a bit better if the ending made more sense and was not so rushed. once reading we did activities that were based on your book. After reading I had so many questions that I wanted to ask. I was so happy that I got the chance to ask you questions about your amazing book. I was wondering-<br>Where did you get inspiration from before writing this book?<br>Did you know about XP or knew anyone who had it if so why pick XP?<br>
                        What would you be thinking or if you were in Viola's situation?<br>Who is your favorite character and why?<br>What made you think to become an author?<br><br>I really loved your book and in my blog, I have posted a book review about your book and it would be amazing if you commented on it.<br><br>Thank you<br>Kind regards</p>

                        <p class="about">Hi Rieya<br>8/10 is not bad! I can live with that! I saw a TV doco about XP by accident and it inspired me to write the book – it was so unusual! (This was also when vampire books were huge so writing a non-vampire book about a person who can’t go out in the sun was pretty cool!) I think Viola is a lot braver than me – I couldn’t do the things she does. I like the owl I think – it is my favourite character. Especially how it watches over everyone. I’m an author because I love doing it! Easy.<br>I have commented on your book review – well done!<br>All the best<br>Ella</p>

It was really interesting, could you make a sequel to the book because it still left some questions for me and I'm still really interested in the book the ending didn’t tell us much but the blurb on the back got me hooked. A lot of people in the reading group thought Viola was a vampire because of the condition she has but as we read the story further into it we found out that she was not a vampire she just has a condition. I am very sad that you are not writing a sequel but then again you get to decide what you do with your books<br><br>Here are a few questions I have for you<br>What inspired you to make night vision?<br>What inspired you to write books?<br>How old were you when you first started writing?<br><br>

Sorry, no sequel, but I loved your review on your blog.  To answer your questions – I think I’ve been writing all my life, either as a journalist or later on books for teenagers and when I was a kid I was always writing stuff.  I do it because it’s fun.  Lots of things inspired me to write Night Vision but I think it was mostly the idea of a kid who couldn’t go outside in the sun.  That was so weird.</p>

I recently found out about you because of my teacher. When doing reading, she takes students groups by groups and in that group she makes everyone read specific kind of book, mostly novels and do activities about it like making a description of the characters which tests us if we actually read the book and thought about it deeply. My reading group and I read your book "Night Vision" and even did a review about it and posted it on our blog.<br><br>I really enjoyed reading your book "Night Vision". The summary was intriguing. It hooks the reader, I think I know why our teacher chose the book for us to read.<br>If you made a sequel of the book, I'd love to read it because I'd want to know what will happen if it was extended.<br><br>
                        I have questions about Night Vision for you if you don't mind answering them.<br><br>- What were you feeling when writing the book?<br>- What inspired you to write the book?<br>- If you were Viola in the story, would've you done the same things that she did?<br>- Were there certain events in the book that you wished you could've improved on?<br>- Who's your favourite character in the book? if you have one :)<br><br>For me, your book Night Vision is a Top-Notch, I wish it gets more recognition though. Please continue to write more amazing stories in the future.</p>

                        <p class="about">Hi Skyler<br>To answer your questions all together (because they overlap), I was listening to a lot of music when writing Night Vision – mostly the music Viola plays. I wanted to make the words as musical as possible (try reading some of the passages aloud) and I hoped it worked. I don’t know if I would be brave enough to do some of the things Viola does, but then she has already been through a lot before the book begins and knows she will go through a lot more before her short life will be over. I think my favourite character is the owl – I like how it looks over everything silently! And yes – have commented on your book reviews. THANK YOU for doing them. Wow!<br>Hope you read some fun books this term!<br>(and say hi to your teacher for me!)<br>Ella</p>

                    <p class="about">Dear Ella West,<br><br>Our group here at Hornby Highschool have read one of your fantastic books. Last term we began and finished reading Night Vision.  It was a really excellent book, we all enjoyed reading it; we were all really interested in the plot. I admire that you tackled on a real sickness/disease and brought awareness in it using your writing. Though I hoped that you've extended on how it concluded, I have an understanding of why you may have ended it. It seems the most realistic way that a story such as that would end, at least in my opinion. Thank you for writing that book, I would like to read more of your books in the future.<br><br>-Axle Brigs</p>

                        <p class="about">Hi Axle<br>I always think about Viola’s story in Night Vision as moving from the darkness into the light – the darkness of being on her own to stepping into the light and being acknowledged for who she is. Doing this, whoever you are (whether you have a weird disease or not) always takes courage and Viola finds this courage by dealing with what happens to her in the book. Stepping into the spotlight in front of an audience playing the violin was the only way to end.<br>So glad to hear your class enjoyed the book – all the best with the new term!<br>Ella</p>

                        <p class="about">Hi Ella!<br>Love that you love Rain Fall!  Hmm – something about me.  There is lots on this website under “About Me” but also, just like you, I was horse mad as a kid and didn’t have a horse.  My parents knew nothing about horses and there was no way we could have one in our tiny backyard.  It wasn’t until I got older, left home and met other horse-mad people that I learnt to ride and had a horse.  So, my advice to you is there are lots of horses out there that aren’t getting ridden.  Go find one and ask the owner if you can ride it (only do this if the owner is a nice person!).  Horses need to be ridden at least once a week if not more otherwise they get difficult to ride – they just get lazy and forget that their purpose is to have people on their backs.  If you get the horse so it can be ridden again the owner will be really happy.  But you have to be a good rider to do this (or be prepared to be bucked off a few times!)  Also, maybe check out your local pony club.  They might be able to help.  Good luck!!!!!<br>Ella</p>

Lastly,are you going to write any other books? If so I bet they will be thrilling!<br><br>Thank you for your time, I really love your books.<br>Nelly.</p>

                        <p class="about">Hi Nelly<br>So glad to hear you are enjoying Night Vision!  You might like Rain Fall as well which is another of my books.  I also wrote the Thieves series (Thieves, Anywhere But Here and Real Life).  To answer the rest of your questions, I get my ideas from what is happening around me – what is happening in the news, the things I see and hear about and also the things that have happened to me.  In Night Vision, I have worn night vision goggles a couple of times, and we farm sheep but I don’t play a musical instrument so I had to find someone who did so I could get that part of the novel right.  I haven’t written any books about mythical characters but who knows what I will want to write about in the future!  I like reading adventure, drama and suspense novels too and loved when I was younger Margaret Mahy (The Changeover) and Tessa Duder’s books.  And yes, I am writing more books – no I don’t know when they will be published but I’ll put it up on my website when I do.  Fingers crossed!<br>All the best<br>Ella</p>

                    <p class="about">Hi Ella. I am a huge fan of your book Rain Fall. You probably won’t remember me, but I’m from James Hargest and I was one of the people who went to your workshop thing. At that time, I hadn’t read any of your books but I was always wanting to. I found Rainfall and Night Vision at the school library and was very excited to get the two of them out. I am almost finished reading Rain Fall and on my way to starting Night Vision. I can imagine all the characters; Jack, strong and handsome, Annie, beautiful and sporty. I love your stories so much and they inspire me to write even more of my own. Just a question I have been wondering, were the characters inspired by real life people you know?<br>From your hugest fan, Jessica.</p>

So weird being there again after so many years (why does everything seem smaller!) but it brought back so many memories and was so much fun.  You guys were great.<br>To answer your question - none of my characters are based on real people.  I’m really careful about that.  I don’t want anyone I know (especially family) suspecting they’re in a book I’ve written and that’s what I think of them!<br>Lots of the settings (especially in Rain Fall) are real but none of the people.<br>All the best<br>Ella</p>

                    <p class="about">Hi Ella - I just finished reading "Rain Fall" myself in preparation for reading it in class during NZ Read Aloud this TERM (we begin reading next week and it runs from Week 3 to Week 8 inclusive). I was wondering if it would be at all possible for my class to SKYPE you to ask questions about the book and your writing? Last year we had an awesome SKYPE session with Adele Broadbank while we were reading her book "Too Many Secrets". I know you will be extremely busy, and we also have tight time constraints due to our school's programmes, but if it is at all possible we would appreciate it very much.<br>Unfortunately we have been unable to find it.<br>Kind Regards,<br>Christine Earnshaw (Room 3 Bruce McLaren Intermediate School, West Auckland)<br>P.S. I meant to say I LOVED "Rain Fall" which was significant to me as I have recently begun to connect with the West Coast where my family began its NZ journey in 1866 when they arrived in Hokatika and ended up in a tiny community called Red Jacks. From there they moved eventually to Kumara and Greymouth, but some members moved further up the coast and settled around the Westport area.</p>

                        <p class="about">Hi Aleisha<br>If you have Thieves then hang on to it – there are very few copies left!  The second and third books of the trilogy are available at UBS (University Book Shop) in Dunedin – I’m pretty sure they have them in stock but if not ask them to order them for you.  It won’t be a problem.<br>Writers block?  Hmm.  I think the answer is just to keep writing, or if you are stuck in a particular part of the book then skip it, go to a bit where you know what is going to happen, then go back to the bit you were having a problem with.  Sometimes all you have to do is ask yourself what will the characters do next.  Well, it’s morning so they better have breakfast and so you start writing about what they have for breakfast and what they are talking about and then you’re away again.  I think the thing is not to worry about it, don’t call it writers block, just write.  Hope that helps and all the best with your writing.  And thanks for loving Thieves so much!<br>Ella</p>

                    <p class="about">Hello Ella!<br>I recently found this website again, and I was looking through the comments and found one of mine from 2014! I’m from the US but I was in NZ a bit back then and I was also at this writing workshop you did at the Duniden bookstore. I won third place in the murder story flash fiction contest (I don’t know it you remember me haha). Anyways I just re-read Night Vision and I looked this site up and you truly effected the last few years of my life. I was only 11 in 2014 and I kind of liked to write but over the last four years I’ve grown a lot as a writer and a person and I guess that I wanted to just thank you for helping me so much. Deciding what to do in life is a hard decision and as I’m getting closer to college I have to start making these choices and I know that I’ll always keep writing close to heart (or ideally a career to be honest). Anyways thanks again and please keep writing- you are fantastic!</p>

                        <p class="about">Hi Ana<br>Great to hear from you and yes I do remember you!  (It was the American accent.)  I didn’t know you got third in the competition – well done.  Yeah, figuring out a career involving writing is not easy but hopefully you will find something – at least in the US there are a lot more colleges and courses for writers than in New Zealand and hopefully graduates from these are sought after by the industry.  TV, especially with Netflix, is employing large numbers of writers so fingers crossed for you.  It’s exciting times.  Glad you liked Night Vision and hopefully you’ll be able to get a copy of Rain Fall (another murder mystery for teens which has just come out in New Zealand and Australia) in the US through Amazon etc.  If not, find the Allen & Unwin NZ/Australian website and ask them for one.<br>Good luck and all the best and keep writing!<br>Ella</p>
