                    <p class="about">Hi Jessica<br>Easy question – I saw a 60 minutes doco on TV about kids with XP and I thought what would a kid see who could only go out at night and then I thought the worst thing they could see would be a murder. Then would they tell anyone about the murder, if it then meant they would no longer be able allowed to go out again at night? The rest, after that was easy – of course Viola would lie to protect her freedom, she has to live on a farm because that makes her isolated and vulnerable and her understanding that one day soon she will die makes her brave. She’s a great character. So glad you like my books.<br>Good luck with your English project!<br>Ella</p>

                <p class="about">Hello :)<br>I am a year 12 aspiring to become an author and was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?<br>The first is about money. I’m not going to ask how much you earn because I don’t that would be fair. I’m not really sure how to word this. But..is your income substantial enough to support you? I’ll understand if you don’t answer this one but I wanted to ask anyway because its something I’m a bit worried about. The next is..with it currently being so difficult for New Zealand authors to get published, do you have any tips that might help?<br>And lastly, would you recommend any writing courses?<br>Thank you xo</p>

                    <p class="about">Hi Alyssa<br>No problem – Money, hmmmm. No, I don’t earn enough to support me (or my family) from writing novels. One day maybe I will. One day maybe I’ll have so much money we won’t know what to do with it but so far that hasn’t happened. But besides that, you never know how much you are going to earn say, in the next 12 months. You never know how many books you are going to sell, if you are going to win any awards, get arts funding or speaking engagements that pay. All this means you can’t go to the bank and get a mortgage to buy a house as you can’t state what your income will be. There are other ways to earn money from writing which do have more reliable incomes such as journalism, PR, a job writing TV scripts, so if you can juggle one of these plus writing fiction then you can find a way to make ends meet and still do what you love.<br>Getting published – well that’s easy, just write a brilliant book. Which is not so easy. If you have a fantastic novel and persevere until you find the right publisher, don’t worry, you will get it published. Worry about writing the story, not what happens next.<br>Writing courses – I haven’t really done any so I can’t recommend any personally but Victoria University is the big one and people who go to it seem to do very well afterwards. There’s also the New Zealand Society of Authors mentoring programme for high school kids and adults (google it and you will find out about it) which is something you should aim for. But mostly read lots. Figure out yourself what works and what doesn’t and why a book is successful or not successful. I hope this helps and all the best. If you have anymore questions just ask.<br>Ella</p>

Either you can buy them (see the Where to Buy page of this blog) or go to your library and ask them to do an interloan for you. An interloan is where your library borrows books from another library – they do it all the time so don’t worry. You just have to ask. Let me know how you get on.<br>all the best<br>Ella</p>

                    <p class='about'>Hi Jarno<br>People think writing a book is the hard bit but it is sending it off to someone who hopefully will help you get it published that is really hard. The waiting, the wondering if it’s good enough – I hate it all! There are a few things that can make it easier (although there is no route to guaranteed success I’m sorry). Firstly, have a look at the New Zealand Society of Authors (NZSA) website http://www.authors.org.nz and you might even think about joining. There is lots of information available through NZSA to help you and at the very least you will get to meet people who are going through the same struggle as you. Secondly – keep writing and don’t give up.<br>all the best<br>Ella</p>

                <p class='about'>Hi Ella,<br>This is so exciting if your reading this.<br>My teacher gave me your book about three years ago and she said it was great even though I never read I gave it a shot; I loved it!!! It was the first real book I read and I hated that there wasn’t more after them. Then afew weeks ago I was at the library and searched your book to get it out and I saw that it was a trilogy!! So I got them all out and have been falling asleep with your books in my hands at about 5am. Now I’m getting width draws because I’m not hearing about what Nicky is doing. I can’t wait until Asorbed comes out and more of your books after that. Thankyou soooooo much :D Its great to hae awesome kiwi authors.<br>From Jess 15 Wellington(:</p>

                <p class='about'>Hello. Yes a tv series would be very brillaint I think. I know lots of people who would watch it. Two of my friends have also read your books. I think they would like to watch it on tv also. If we wrote a letter to a place that does TV series would that help it become a TV series?<br>Thank you for replying. I was very suprised. It is nice to get a reply from a writer you think is brilliant. thank you. bye.</p>

                    <p class='about'>Hi Candance<br>I course I would always reply – you read my books!<br>And thank you for getting me thinking just how to get the story told on the screen – it’s not easy knocking on doors in Hollywood, especially when you live in Dunedin, but I’m going to give it a go and, of course, will let you know what happens. As to writing letters, I think the best thing is for you and your friends to leave comments on this site about how you would love to see the story as a movie or a TV series. Then interested producers, when they check out this site, can see them all.<br>Here’s fingers crossed. I’ll need a lot of luck!<br>Ella</p>

                <p class='about'>Hello. I am a fan of your books. I have just finished reading real life. I like it alot. It is very brilliant. The only problem with it is now there is none left to read. I did not want it to end. I want to know what hapens next. I also want to know who lived and who died. I hope that you write lots mroe books. I will read them. Even if they are not about Nicky and the others. I will keep cheekign the libary when I am there. I hope that you write lots more books. Thank you for writing the books about Nicky and the others. bye.</p>

                    <p class='about'>Hi Candance<br>Thanks so much – it’s great to know people are loving the Thieves Trilogy. <br>It makes all the hard work so much easier!<br>Yes, it would be great to figure out “the what happens next” at the end of Real Life but at this stage the publishers are not interested and unless film or TV get involved (wouldn’t it make a great TV series?!) there is not a lot I can do – getting a story out there is not just in the hands of the writer! But thanks again for your comments – they made my day!<br>Ella</p>
