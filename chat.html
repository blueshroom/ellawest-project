                    <p class="about">Hi Ella,<br><br>I was searching the web for an online version of the Thieves Trilogy and I came across your website and read through some of the other comments and saw you had replied back; it‚Äôs so kind and I thought I would like to write something to you too.üôÇ I was wondering, did Nicky actually love Jake or Paul, or both? And did everyone else die apart from her? In the dream where Nicky was on the beach and Jake was on a hospital bed in the ocean, what was the meaning behind it? Another thing, well I got so excited when I saw that Nicky was from New Zealand (I live there) as the story is set elsewhere. What made you to make her kiwi? ‚Äì Not many people know of this country.<br><br>Next year I‚Äôm going to high school and I want to improve in my English, which is why I‚Äôm reading lots of books. (In previous years, I haven‚Äôt been a big reader) The librarian at school recommend me the series, so I decided to read it. I found it so amazing and recommended it to a friend of mine, who loves it as well. Thank you for giving me the joy of reading your books and I hope you write more! Thank you.<br><br>Yours faithfully,<br>Stella</p>

                        <p class="about">Sorry, I don‚Äôt think the online version is available anymore ‚Äì the series is officially ‚Äúout of print‚Äù. To buy the books ring University Book Shop in Dunedin and they can send copies anywhere in the country (or the world!) Hmm, Nicky did love Paul and she loved Jake ‚Äì I think you fall in love with the people you need and in the books Nicky‚Äôs needs change. I think she would have always fallen for Jake right at the start but he was with Tina. In the fourth book, it makes sense a lot more (still to find a publisher for the fourth book but things are happening . . .) Of course Nicky is from New Zealand ‚Äì so am I and will always be proud of it. It‚Äôs Nicky against the world!<br>And yes, I‚Äôm still writing books ‚Äì there‚Äôs Night Vision which got published by Allen & Unwin in 2014 and won lots of prizes last year and today my agent just sent a new book to them and (coincidence!!!!) one of the characters is called Stella ‚Äì I‚Äôm not kidding. Fingers crossed the publisher likes it!<br>PS I love your librarian!</p>

Then would they tell anyone about the murder, if it then meant they would no longer be able allowed to go out again at night? The rest, after that was easy ‚Äì of course Viola would lie to protect her freedom, she has to live on a farm because that makes her isolated and vulnerable and her understanding that one day soon she will die makes her brave. She‚Äôs a great character. So glad you like my books.<br>Good luck with your English project!<br>Ella</p>

                    <p class="about">Hello :)<br>I am a year 12 aspiring to become an author and was wondering if I could ask you a few questions?<br>The first is about money. I‚Äôm not going to ask how much you earn because I don‚Äôt that would be fair. I‚Äôm not really sure how to word this. But..is your income substantial enough to support you? I‚Äôll understand if you don‚Äôt answer this one but I wanted to ask anyway because its something I‚Äôm a bit worried about. The next is..with it currently being so difficult for New Zealand authors to get published, do you have any tips that might help?<br>And lastly, would you recommend any writing courses?<br>Thank you xo</p>

                        <p class="about">Hi Alyssa<br>No problem ‚Äì Money, hmmmm. No, I don‚Äôt earn enough to support me (or my family) from writing novels. One day maybe I will. One day maybe I‚Äôll have so much money we won‚Äôt know what to do with it but so far that hasn‚Äôt happened. But besides that, you never know how much you are going to earn say, in the next 12 months. You never know how many books you are going to sell, if you are going to win any awards, get arts funding or speaking engagements that pay. All this means you can‚Äôt go to the bank and get a mortgage to buy a house as you can‚Äôt state what your income will be. There are other ways to earn money from writing which do have more reliable incomes such as journalism, PR, a job writing TV scripts, so if you can juggle one of these plus writing fiction then you can find a way to make ends meet and still do what you love.<br>Getting published ‚Äì well that‚Äôs easy, just write a brilliant book. Which is not so easy. If you have a fantastic novel and persevere until you find the right publisher, don‚Äôt worry, you will get it published. Worry about writing the story, not what happens next.<br>Writing courses ‚Äì I haven‚Äôt really done any so I can‚Äôt recommend any personally but Victoria University is the big one and people who go to it seem to do very well afterwards. There‚Äôs also the New Zealand Society of Authors mentoring programme for high school kids and adults (google it and you will find out about it) which is something you should aim for. But mostly read lots. Figure out yourself what works and what doesn‚Äôt and why a book is successful or not successful. I hope this helps and all the best. If you have anymore questions just ask.<br>Ella</p>

The waiting, the wondering if it‚Äôs good enough ‚Äì I hate it all! There are a few things that can make it easier (although there is no route to guaranteed success I‚Äôm sorry). Firstly, have a look at the New Zealand Society of Authors (NZSA) website http://www.authors.org.nz and you might even think about joining. There is lots of information available through NZSA to help you and at the very least you will get to meet people who are going through the same struggle as you.
