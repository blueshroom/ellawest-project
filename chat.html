                        <p class="about">Hi Ella!<br>Love that you love Rain Fall!  Hmm – something about me.  There is lots on this website under “About Me” but also, just like you, I was horse mad as a kid and didn’t have a horse.  My parents knew nothing about horses and there was no way we could have one in our tiny backyard.  It wasn’t until I got older, left home and met other horse-mad people that I learnt to ride and had a horse.  So, my advice to you is there are lots of horses out there that aren’t getting ridden.  Go find one and ask the owner if you can ride it (only do this if the owner is a nice person!).  Horses need to be ridden at least once a week if not more otherwise they get difficult to ride – they just get lazy and forget that their purpose is to have people on their backs.  If you get the horse so it can be ridden again the owner will be really happy.  But you have to be a good rider to do this (or be prepared to be bucked off a few times!)  Also, maybe check out your local pony club.  They might be able to help.  Good luck!!!!!<br>Ella</p>

I am currently reading your book 'Night Vision' and I love the adventure and drama in the book.<br><br>I just have a some questions I would like to ask you. My first question is, what's your opinion - which other New Zealand books would you recommend to me? I love adventure, drama, suspense and sometimes make belief characters. Another of my questions is, where or how do you get your ideas and inspiration? Thirdly, how many books have you done? And have you done any books about mythical characters? Lastly,are you going to write any other books? If so I bet they will be thrilling!<br><br>Thank you for your time, I really love your books.<br>Nelly.</p>

                        <p class="about">Hi Nelly<br>So glad to hear you are enjoying Night Vision!  You might like Rain Fall as well which is another of my books.  I also wrote the Thieves series (Thieves, Anywhere But Here and Real Life).  To answer the rest of your questions, I get my ideas from what is happening around me – what is happening in the news, the things I see and hear about and also the things that have happened to me.  In Night Vision, I have worn night vision goggles a couple of times, and we farm sheep but I don’t play a musical instrument so I had to find someone who did so I could get that part of the novel right.  I haven’t written any books about mythical characters but who knows what I will want to write about in the future!  I like reading adventure, drama and suspense novels too and loved when I was younger Margaret Mahy (The Changeover) and Tessa Duder’s books.  And yes, I am writing more books – no I don’t know when they will be published but I’ll put it up on my website when I do.  Fingers crossed!<br>All the best<br>Ella</p>

You probably won’t remember me, but I’m from James Hargest and I was one of the people who went to your workshop thing. At that time, I hadn’t read any of your books but I was always wanting to. I found Rainfall and Night Vision at the school library and was very excited to get the two of them out. I am almost finished reading Rain Fall and on my way to starting Night Vision. I can imagine all the characters; Jack, strong and handsome, Annie, beautiful and sporty. I love your stories so much and they inspire me to write even more of my own. Just a question I have been wondering, were the characters inspired by real life people you know?<br>From your hugest fan, Jessica.</p>

                    <p class="about">Hi Ella - I just finished reading "Rain Fall" myself in preparation for reading it in class during NZ Read Aloud this TERM (we begin reading next week and it runs from Week 3 to Week 8 inclusive). I was wondering if it would be at all possible for my class to SKYPE you to ask questions about the book and your writing? Last year we had an awesome SKYPE session with Adele Broadbank while we were reading her book "Too Many Secrets". I know you will be extremely busy, and we also have tight time constraints due to our school's programmes, but if it is at all possible we would appreciate it very much.<br>Unfortunately we have been unable to find it.<br>Kind Regards,<br>Christine Earnshaw (Room 3 Bruce McLaren Intermediate School, West Auckland)<br>P.S. I meant to say I LOVED "Rain Fall" which was significant to me as I have recently begun to connect with the West Coast where my family began its NZ journey in 1866 when they arrived in Hokatika and ended up in a tiny community called Red Jacks. From there they moved eventually to Kumara and Greymouth, but some members moved further up the coast and settled around the Westport area.</p>

                        <p class="about">Hi Aleisha<br>If you have Thieves then hang on to it – there are very few copies left!  The second and third books of the trilogy are available at UBS (University Book Shop) in Dunedin – I’m pretty sure they have them in stock but if not ask them to order them for you.  It won’t be a problem.<br>Writers block?  Hmm.  I think the answer is just to keep writing, or if you are stuck in a particular part of the book then skip it, go to a bit where you know what is going to happen, then go back to the bit you were having a problem with.  Sometimes all you have to do is ask yourself what will the characters do next.  Well, it’s morning so they better have breakfast and so you start writing about what they have for breakfast and what they are talking about and then you’re away again.  I think the thing is not to worry about it, don’t call it writers block, just write.  Hope that helps and all the best with your writing.  And thanks for loving Thieves so much!<br>Ella</p>

                    <p class="about">Hello Ella!<br>I recently found this website again, and I was looking through the comments and found one of mine from 2014! I’m from the US but I was in NZ a bit back then and I was also at this writing workshop you did at the Duniden bookstore. I won third place in the murder story flash fiction contest (I don’t know it you remember me haha). Anyways I just re-read Night Vision and I looked this site up and you truly effected the last few years of my life. I was only 11 in 2014 and I kind of liked to write but over the last four years I’ve grown a lot as a writer and a person and I guess that I wanted to just thank you for helping me so much. Deciding what to do in life is a hard decision and as I’m getting closer to college I have to start making these choices and I know that I’ll always keep writing close to heart (or ideally a career to be honest). Anyways thanks again and please keep writing- you are fantastic!</p>

Yeah, figuring out a career involving writing is not easy but hopefully you will find something – at least in the US there are a lot more colleges and courses for writers than in New Zealand and hopefully graduates from these are sought after by the industry.  TV, especially with Netflix, is employing large numbers of writers so fingers crossed for you.  It’s exciting times.  Glad you liked Night Vision and hopefully you’ll be able to get a copy of Rain Fall (another murder mystery for teens which has just come out in New Zealand and Australia) in the US through Amazon etc.  If not, find the Allen & Unwin NZ/Australian website and ask them for one.<br>Good luck and all the best and keep writing!<br>Ella</p>
