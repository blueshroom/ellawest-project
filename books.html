                    <h3>Night Vision</h3>
                    <p>Viola was born with a genetic condition that makes sunlight deadly. In the dark of night, when most teenagers are tucked up in bed, Viola has the run of her parents' farm and the surrounding forest. She is used to seeing hidden things through her night-vision goggles, but one night she sees something that could get her into a whole lot of trouble...</p>
                    <p>Viola has always believed she would be dead before she was twenty, but now she must decide just how far she's willing to go to help her parents keep their beloved farm. Is it okay to steal from a thief? What if the thief might be a killer? And what if the killer threatens to come after her and her family?</p>

                    <h3>Thieves</h3>
                    <p><i>Nicky has a secret. Now you see her: now you don’t.</i></p> 
                    <p>She has the ability to disappear and reappear in another place – her gift controlled through the powers of thought alone. Someone else has discovered Nicky’s extrasensory talent: a group called the Project. Anonymous, benign in manner, yet also sinister in its secrecy, the Project spirits Nicky and four others away to a desert hideaway. Constantly monitored by security, taken from their families and even their own countries, Nicky and her fellow travellers are gradually pushed into a world of espionage and intrigue. But who are they working for? Is the Project inherently good, or is it inherently evil?</p>

                    <h3>Anywhere But Here</h3>
                    <p><i>Like wanted criminals, Nicky and the other travellers are on the run.  But what’s their crime?</i></p>
                    <p>They all have an extraordinary gift: the ability to transport themselves anywhere, through the powers of thought alone.  Pursuing the travellers is the Project, an organisation that abducted them from their parents, virtually enslaving them, and pushed them to carry out secret missions. Until they escaped. Now the five teenagers are in Los Angeles, trying to keep one step ahead of their pursuers. They might make it if they work as a team – but loyalties are shifting. In one head-long dash, the travellers must find out what they want, and who they want to be, but the Project is shadowing their every move.</p>

                    <p>But Nicky won’t be confined. She continues to brood on escape, but discovers a swim team in a nearby town, returning to what she loves. But for how long will the Project tolerate her small slice of freedom? Meanwhile, the Project is caught up in sinister, questionable affairs. When terrorists threaten, Nicky is sent to the dangerous heart of the matter. No longer afraid of her remarkable abilities, and no longer willing to let others decide for her, Nicky is on the brink of retrieving her own real life. But destructive forces close in . . . </p>
