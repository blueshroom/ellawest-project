                <p class="post">Rain Fall is part of this amazing list! It’s one of the finalists for the 2019 Ngaio Marsh Award for Best Novel which is for crime books written by New Zealanders. There are two other books for teens included – Brian Falkner’s Outlaw and Tina Shaw’s Make a Hard Fist. Check them out! Dame Ngaio Marsh was one of New Zealand’s best crime writers. She was born in 1895 in Christchurch and died in 1982 and was known as one of the then “Queens of Crime” along with Agatha Christie. This is the tenth year of the awards in her name and I am honoured to be part of it.</p>

                <p class="datestamp">14 May 2018</p>
                <p class="post">I can never say no to school visits and just spent two days in Southland visiting in Invercargill James Hargest College (my old school!!!!!) and Menzies College in Wyndham as well as talking at a SLANZA meeting.  Two really different schools as one is a big city school (over 1500 kids) and Menzies is in the heart of dairy and sheep country.  We talked about heroes in books and story structure and hopefully I made it a bit easier for them to write their own stories.  Teachers always think this is work for me (which it is – I’m usually exhausted afterwards!) but this is the way I connect with my readers and find out what they want in books.</p>
                <img src="images/menziescollege.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="15 November 2017" id="newcover">
                <p class="post">It’s always great to hear comments afterwards too.  Here are some from the Menzies College year seven kids:</p>
                <p class="post">“Just started reading Rain Fall and loving it”<br>“She was a good explainer - you could picture the books in your head”<br>“She's da man!”<br>“I really want to read Night Vision!”</p>              
                <p class="post">So if you want me at your school get in touch.  Would love to meet you!</p>

                <p class="post">Been meaning to tell you about the Bologna Children’s Book Fair.  It’s in northern Italy and is the biggest children’s book fair in the world and is held every May.  My publisher Allen & Unwin represent me there every year but this time my books were also there at the Dunedin City of Literature stand.</p>
                <p class="post">Dunedin, where I live, was given the opportunity because it is a UNESCO City of Literature and Bologna, being a UNESCO City of Music, invited us there. I wrote it about for <i>The Sapling</i> which you can read in the link below. So, pretty exciting, for Dunedin and for me!</p>

And it’s the one that made me cry when I wrote the ending (see post 2/3/2016) so it’s dear to my heart and it has a murder and a girl and a boy and it’s set in one of the most amazing places in the country.  Hope the waiting will not be too unbearable but it will be worth it, I PROMISE.</p>

This doesn't mean that a film is definitely going to get made but it's a step (a very small step) to that happening and it is so great that the commission thinks it's a story that could be made into a film. Wow. Very, very exciting!</p>

A fabulous novel." I'm trying to get my head around being compared with such heavy weights in the book industry. Wow. And you can buy it in Italy for 12 euro!</p>

                    <p class="latest">I lived in Westport for about 15 years after I graduated from university.  I went there for my first fulltime job and fell in love with the place.  When I went back a few years ago for an author tour, a pupil at one of my talks asked me why I hadn’t written a book set in Westport and I didn’t have an answer.  So I wrote this book.
