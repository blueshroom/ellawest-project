                <p class="datestamp">13 May 2017</p>
                <p class="post">Been meaning to tell you about the Bologna Children’s Book Fair.  It’s in northern Italy and is the biggest children’s book fair in the world and is held every May.  My publisher Allen & Unwin represent me there every year but this time my books were also there at the Dunedin City of Literature stand.</p>
                <p class="post">Dunedin, where I live, was given the opportunity because it is a UNESCO City of Literature and Bologna, being a UNESCO City of Music, invited us there. I wrote it about for <i>The Sapling</i> which you can read in the link below. So, pretty exciting, for Dunedin and for me!</p>

                <p class="post">Latest news!  My new book is coming out March 2018 (I know, so far away!) with Allen & Unwin.  And it’s the one that made me cry when I wrote the ending (see post 2/3/2016) so it’s dear to my heart and it has a murder and a girl and a boy and it’s set in one of the most amazing places in the country.  Hope the waiting will not be too unbearable but it will be worth it, I PROMISE.</p>

                <p class="post">It's official - I can tell everyone! The New Zealand Film Commission is funding the writing of a script for Night Vision. This doesn't mean that a film is definitely going to get made but it's a step (a very small step) to that happening and it is so great that the commission thinks it's a story that could be made into a film. Wow. Very, very exciting!</p>

                <p class="post">My Italian copies of Night Vision have arrived in the mail and not only are they hard cover (I've never been published in hard cover before) but the yellow piece at the bottom translates as (thank you to Google) "As poetic as The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time and as disturbing as The Lovely Bones. A fabulous novel." I'm trying to get my head around being compared with such heavy weights in the book industry. Wow. And you can buy it in Italy for 12 euro!</p>

She likes cooking and gardening but doesn’t like cleaning the bathroom. She occasionally goes trout fishing with her family and they hate her when she catches a fish and they don’t. Her chickens keep getting out and destroying her garden. In other words, life is tough.</p>

                    <p class="latest">I lived in Westport for about 15 years after I graduated from university.  I went there for my first fulltime job and fell in love with the place.  When I went back a few years ago for an author tour, a pupil at one of my talks asked me why I hadn’t written a book set in Westport and I didn’t have an answer.  So I wrote this book.
